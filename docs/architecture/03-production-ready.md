1. **Stop Services**
   ```bash
   ./scripts/stop.sh
   ```

2. **Restore Database**
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d postgres
   docker compose exec -T postgres pg_restore \

## 💾 Backup & Recovery

### Automated Backups

- **Schedule**: 23:30 IST daily (configured in worker)
- **Location**: `./salon-data/backups/`
- **Format**: PostgreSQL custom format (.sql)
- **Retention**: 7 days (configurable via `BACKUP_RETENTION_DAYS`)

### Manual Backup

```bash
# Create manual backup
./scripts/backup.sh

# Output: ./backups/salon-backup-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.sql
```

### Restore from Backup

```bash
# Stop services
./scripts/stop.sh

# Start only PostgreSQL
docker compose up -d postgres
sleep 10

# Restore database
docker compose exec -T postgres pg_restore \
  -U salon_user -d salon_db --clean < backups/backup-file.sql

# Start all services
./scripts/start.sh
```

### Disaster Recovery

**Complete System Failure:**

1. Install Aasan on new hardware (follow CLIENT_INSTALL.md)
2. Configure with same `.env` values
3. Start only PostgreSQL: `docker compose up -d postgres`
4. Restore latest backup (see above)
5. Start all services: `./scripts/start.sh`
6. Verify data integrity

**Data Corruption:**

1. Stop services immediately
2. Restore from most recent clean backup
3. Investigate and fix root cause
4. Resume operations

## 📈 Monitoring & Maintenance

### Health Checks

```bash
# Service status
docker compose ps

# API health
curl http://localhost/api/healthz

# Database connectivity
docker compose exec postgres pg_isready -U salon_user

# Redis connectivity
docker compose exec redis redis-cli -a ${REDIS_PASSWORD} ping

# Resource usage
docker stats
```

### Log Monitoring

```bash
# View all logs
docker compose logs -f

# View specific service
docker compose logs -f api
docker compose logs -f worker

# Search for errors
docker compose logs api | grep ERROR
```

### Disk Space Monitoring

```bash
# Check disk usage
df -h

# Check Docker disk usage
docker system df

# Clean old images (if needed)
docker system prune -a
```

### Database Maintenance

```bash
# Database size
docker compose exec postgres psql -U salon_user -d salon_db \
  -c "SELECT pg_size_pretty(pg_database_size('salon_db'));"

# Table sizes
docker compose exec postgres psql -U salon_user -d salon_db \
  -c "SELECT tablename, pg_size_pretty(pg_total_relation_size(tablename::text)) \
      FROM pg_tables WHERE schemaname = 'public' ORDER BY 2 DESC;"

# Vacuum (reclaim space)
docker compose exec postgres psql -U salon_user -d salon_db -c "VACUUM ANALYZE;"
```

## 📋 Known Limitations

### Current Phase (v1.0)

**Included:**
- POS & Billing with GST
- Appointment scheduling
- Inventory management
- Expense tracking
- Reports & accounting
- User management
- Automated backups

**Not Included (Future Phases):**
- Customer self-booking portal
- WhatsApp integration
- SMS notifications
- Advanced analytics
- Multi-location support
- Cloud sync

### Technical Limitations

- **Single-instance only**: No clustering/high-availability
- **Local network only**: No internet access required (by design)
- **HTTPS via self-signed certificate**: HTTPS is configured with automatic HTTP-to-HTTPS redirect. Run `./scripts/setup-https.sh` to generate certificates. See `HTTPS-SETUP.md` for full details
- **Manual updates**: No automatic update mechanism
- **WSL2 networking**: Windows/WSL2 deployments require additional port forwarding configuration. See [`docs/deployment/05-wsl2-quickstart.md`](../deployment/05-wsl2-quickstart.md) for setup instructions

## 🔐 Security Recommendations

### Must Do (Critical)

1. Change default owner password on first login
2. Use strong, unique passwords (32+ characters)
3. Secure .env file permissions (chmod 600)
4. Enable firewall (allow ports 80 and 443)
5. Regular backups (verify automatic job is running)
6. Keep system updated (OS and Docker)

### Should Do (Important)

1. Configure static IP for server
2. Set a static IP for consistent LAN access
3. Restrict physical access to server
4. Create individual user accounts (don't share)
5. Review logs weekly for anomalies
6. Test backup restoration monthly

### Nice to Have (Recommended)

1. UPS for power backup
2. Secondary backup to external drive
3. Network monitoring
4. Regular security audits
5. Trust self-signed SSL certificate on client devices (see `HTTPS-SETUP.md`)
6. VPN for remote access (if needed)
